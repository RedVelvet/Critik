I made different versions of each icon to test which ends up working best.
Let me know if we need to consider different dimensions or colors.


1st word: icon type
number: approximate height in pixels of icon
*2nd word: icon background (transparent or colored background)

*If the background is not transparent, the dimensions of the icon is as listed, 
but the whole image size is 54x54 as requested by Dalton.

Example: play25trans.png
icon type = play
icon height = 22px
icon background = transparent

Example2: options44bg.png
icon type = options
icon height = 44px
icon background = colored background (app green in this case)
